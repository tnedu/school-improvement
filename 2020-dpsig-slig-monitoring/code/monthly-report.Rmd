This monthly report provides an update on chronic absenteeism and student discipline in your district's CSI school(s) as well as CSI schools in other districts. With some exceptions, CSI schools (short for Comprehensive Support and Improvement) are also known as Priority schools.

The Division of School Improvement (DSI) will refer to this report in regular check-ins with districts that have CSI schools, and DSI will also ask the following questions to learn supplement this report with additional information:

* Student chronic absenteeism
    + What factors have contributed to students' chronic absenteeism this month (or the lack thereof)?  How do you plan (or have you planned) to address these factors?
    + To what extent has chronic absenteeism varied by student group (e.g., Black or African American, English Learners, Male, Students with Disabilities)?

* Student out-of-school discipline
    + What factors have contributed to students' discipline rates this month (or the lack thereof)? How do you plan (or have you planned) to address these factors?
    + To what extent have discipline rates varied by student group (e.g., Black or African American, English Learners, Male, Students with Disabilities)?

*	Student mobility
    + What factors have contributed to student mobility this month (or the lack thereof)? How do you plan (or have you planned) to address these factors?
    + To what extent has student mobility varied by student group (e.g., Black or African American, English Learners, Male, Students with Disabilities)?
    + Where do students who leave your Priority schools typically go? Where do new students typically come from?

\newpage

*	Teachers
    + What factors have contributed to teacher turnover this month (or the lack thereof)? How do you plan (or have you planned) to address these factors?
    + What factors have contributed to teacher chronic absenteeism this month (or the lack thereof)? How do you plan (or have you planned) to address these factors?

Disclaimer: No graph in this report can predict end-of-year outcomes with 100% accuracy due to a variety of reasons (e.g., changes in business rules, data quality throughout the year). Draw conclusions cautiously.

# Student Chronic Absenteeism
